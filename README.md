## ALX System Engineering and DevOps

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts and exercises that I wrote as part of the ALX System Engineering and DevOps track. The goal of these scripts is to help students learn about Bash scripting and how to use it to automate tasks.

The scripts are organized into the following categories:

* **0x00. Shell, basics:** This category contains scripts that cover the basics of the Bash shell, such as variables, commands, and loops.
* **0x01. Shell, permissions:** This category contains scripts that cover Linux permissions and how to change them.
* **0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters:** This category contains scripts that cover I/O redirections and filters, which are used to manipulate input and output.
* **0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions:** This category contains scripts that cover Bash init files, variables, and expansions.
* **0x04-loops,conditions, and,parsing:** This category contains scripts that cover loops, conditions, and parsing.
* **0x06-regular, expressions:** This category contains scripts that cover regular expressions.
* **0x08-networking, basics, 2:** This category contains scripts that cover basic networking concepts, such as IP addresses and TCP/UDP.
* **0x09-web, infrastructure, design:** This category contains scripts that cover web infrastructure design, such as web servers and databases.
* **0x0A-configuration, management:** This category contains scripts that cover configuration management, such as Ansible and Puppet.

To use the scripts, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the scripts from the command line.
For example, to run the script called `hello_world.sh`, you would run the following command:
